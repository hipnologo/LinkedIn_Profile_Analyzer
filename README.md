# LinkedIn Profile Analyzer

The LinkedIn Profile Analyzer is a Python application that analyzes your LinkedIn profile and provides suggestions for improvement. It uses the LinkedIn API to extract relevant information from your profile, and the Spacy library to analyze the text and identify areas for improvement. The application is designed to be run in a web browser using the Streamlit library.

## Installation

To run the LinkedIn Profile Analyzer, you will need to install the following libraries:

- `streamlit`

- `spacy`
- `en_core_web_sm`

You can install these libraries using the following command:

``` 
pip install streamlit linkedin-api spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```


You will also need to set up a LinkedIn Developer account and obtain API credentials. You can do this by following the instructions on the [LinkedIn Developer Platform website](https://www.linkedin.com/developers/).

## Usage
